        <p>Nerve agents, sometimes also called nerve gases, are a class of organic chemicals that disrupt the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages to organs.
             The disruption is caused by the blocking of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine,
             a neurotransmitter. Nerve agents are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used as poison.
            Poisoning by a nerve agent leads to constriction of pupils, profuse salivation, convulsions,
             and involuntary urination and defecation, with the first symptoms appearing in seconds after exposure.
              Death by asphyxiation or cardiac arrest may follow in minutes due to the loss of the body's control over respiratory and other muscles. Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or aerosolized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the respiratory system. Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a respirator.
            Nerve agents are generally colorless, tasteless liquids that may evaporate to a gas.
             Agents Sarin and VX are odorless; Tabun has a slightly fruity odor and Soman has a slight camphor odor.</p>
